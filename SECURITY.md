1. **Do Not** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed by our team.

2. Please email us at pravdevrav@gmail.com with details of the vulnerability. If possible, encrypt your message using our PGP key (available on our website).

3. Include the following information in your report:
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
   - The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the vulnerability, including how an attacker might exploit it

4. Allow us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before disclosing it to the public or a third party. We aim to respond to security reports within 48 hours and will strive to keep you informed about our progress towards a fix.

## Security Update Process

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
2. Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
3. Prepare fixes for all supported versions.
